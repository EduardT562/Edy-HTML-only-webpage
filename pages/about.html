          <b>Hello there!</b>&nbsp;My name is <b>Topliceanu Eduard</b> and I'm
          an technical university graduate recently reprofiled on Web
          Development with good knowledge of
          <strong>
            HTML5, CSS3, SASS and JavaScript. (currently learning Angular)
          </strong>
          I have discovered a passion for software development and recently I
          have stepped up in a career switch. I have acquired new skills in a
          short time frame by attending New Techâ€™s course and I am ready to
          exceed my ambitions in this domain and willing to learn new things and
          do what it takes to achieve my dream job.
